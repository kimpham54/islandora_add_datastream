# Islandora Add Datastream

1. Go to any collection > Manage
1. Add an object to this Collection
1. Option to Add License Datastream. Usually PDF or txt. Click on checkbox 'click here to agree', acknowledging license deposit
1. Click through the rest of the ingest steps
1. When ingested, in object, go to Manage > Datastreams and LICENSE should appear
